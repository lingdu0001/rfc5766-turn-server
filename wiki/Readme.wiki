== GENERAL INFORMATION ==

[http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/wiki/newDownloadsSite?tm=2 Project Downloads]

       The  *TURN Server* project contains the source code of a TURN server and
       TURN client messaging library. Also, some extra programs	provided,  for
       testing-only purposes.

       See the INSTALL file for	the building instructions.

       After the build,	you will have the following binary images:

 *     _*turnserver*_:  *TURN Server* relay. The compiled binary image of this program is located in bin/ sub-directory.
 *     _*turnadmin*_: TURN administration tool. This tool can be used for:
   # generation	of TURN keys for the user accounts. For security reasons, we do not recommend storing passwords openly. The better	option is to use pre-processed "keys" which are then used for authentication. These keys are generated by _turnadmin_.
   # listing available users in flat file, or in databases.
   # adding and deleting users in the flat file or in the databases.
   # updating user passwords. 
   # setting shared secret for TURN REST API.
 *     _*turnutils_uclient*_: emulates multiple UDP,TCP,TLS or DTLS  clients. The compiled binary image of this program is located in bin/ sub-directory.
 *	_*turnutils_peer*_: a simple stateless UDP-only "echo" server, to be used as the final server in relay pattern ("_peer_"). For every incoming UDP packet, it simply echoes it back.  (this program is provided for the testing purposes only !)	When the test clients are communicating in the	client-to-client manner, this component	is not needed. The compiled binary image of this program is located in bin/ subdirectory.
 *	_*turnutils_stunclient*_: a simple STUN	client example that implements RFC 5389 and RFC 5780.	 The  compiled	binary image of this program is located in bin/ subdirectory.
 *	_*turnutils_rfc5769check*_: a utility that checks the correctness of the STUN/TURN protocol implementation. This program will perform several checks and print the result on the screen. It will exit with 0 status if everything is OK, and with (-1) if there was an error in the protocol implementation.   

       In the "examples/scripts"	subdirectory, you will find the	 examples  of  command
       lines to	be used	to run the programs. The scripts are meant to be run from examples/ subdirectory, for example:
{{{
	$ cd examples
	$ ./scripts/longtermsecure/secure_relay.sh
}}}

== RUN ==

===turnserver application: a TURN relay server implementation===

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ turnserver [flags] [-n | -c <config-file>] [ --userdb=<userdb-file> | --psql-userdb=<db-conn-string> | --mysql-userdb=<db-conn-string> ] [options]
       $ turnserver -h
}}}

[http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/wiki/turnserver TURNSERVER WIKI PAGE]

=== turnadmin application: a TURN relay administration tool===

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ turnadmin [command] [options]
       $ turnadmin [ -h	| --help]
}}}

[http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/wiki/turnadmin TURNADMIN WIKI PAGE]

=== turnutils_uclient application (for test purposes only)===
  It was designed to simulate multiple clients. It uses asynch IO API in  libevent to  handle  multiple  clients. A  client connects to the relay, negotiates the session, and sends	multiple  (configured  number) messages	to  the	 server	 (relay), expecting the	same number of replies. The length of the messages is configurable.   The  message is an arbitrary octet stream, but it	can be configured as a string.  The number of the messages to send is configurable.

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ turnutils_uclient [-tSvsyhcxg] [options]	<TURN-Server-IP-address>
}}}

[http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/wiki/turnutils_uclient UCLIENT WIKI PAGE]

=== turnutils_peer  application (for test purposes ony) ===
turnutils_peer is a simple UDP-only echo backend server. This application is used for the test purposes only, as a '_peer_'  for the _turnutils_uclient_ application.

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ turnutils_peer [-v] [options]
}}}

[http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/wiki/turnutils_peer PEER WIKI PAGE]

=== turnutils_stunclient is a basic STUN client ===
It sends a STUN request and shows the reply information.

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ turnutils_stunclient [options] <STUN-Server-IP-address>
}}}

[http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/wiki/turnutils_stunclient STUNCLIENT WIKI PAGE]

=== turnutils_rfc5769check tests the correctness of STUN protocol ===
It tests the protocol implementation against the test vectors predefined in RFC 5769 and prints the results of the tests on the screen.   
  
====Usage:====  
{{{
$ turnutils_rfc5769check
}}}

== LIBRARIES ==

       In the lib/ sub-directory the build process  will  create  TURN	client
       messaging  library.   In	 the  include/	sub-directory,	the  necessary
       include files will be placed. 
       The C++ wrapper for the messaging functionality is located in TurnMsgLib.h header.
       An example of C++ code can be found in stunclient.c file.

== DOCS ==

In the original archive tree, the command:

	$ man -M man turnserver

will give you the man page.

After the proper installation, the command:

	$ man turnserver
	
will give you the same man page.

In the docs/html subdirectory of the original archive tree, you will find the client library 
reference. After the installation, it will be placed in 
PREFIX/share/doc/turnserver/html.
 
== LOGS ==

When the *TURN Server* starts, it makes efforts to create a log file {{{turnserver_<pid>.log}}} 
in the following directories:

	* /var/log
	* /log/
	* /var/tmp
	* /tmp
	* current directory

If all efforts failed (due to the system permission settings) then all 
log messages are sent only to the standard output of the process.

This behavior can be controlled by --log-file and --no-stdout-log options (see turnserver help).

== CLUSTERS ==

TURN Server can be a part of the cluster installation. But, to support the "even port" functionality 
(RTP/RTCP streams pairs) the client requests from a particular IP must be delivered to the same 
TURN Server instance, so it requires some networking setup massaging for the cluster. The reason is that 
the RTP and RTCP relaying endpoints must be allocated on the same relay IP. It would be possible 
to design a scheme with the application-level requests forwarding (and we may do that later) but 
it would affect the performance.
