== turnutils_uclient application (for test purposes only)==
  It was designed to simulate multiple clients. It uses asynch IO API in  libevent to  handle  multiple  clients. A  client connects to the relay, negotiates the session, and sends	multiple  (configured  number) messages	to  the	 server	 (relay), expecting the	same number of replies. The length of the messages is configurable.   The  message is an arbitrary octet stream, but it	can be configured as a string.  The number of the messages to send is configurable.

===Usage:===
{{{
       $ turnutils_uclient [-tSvsyhcxg] [options]	<TURN-Server-IP-address>
}}}
===Flags:===

 *      *-t*     Use TCP for communications between client and TURN server (default is UDP).
 *      *-T*     Use TCP for the relay transport (default - UDP). Implies options -t, -y, -c, and ignores options -s, -e, -r and -g.
 *      *-P*     Passive TCP (RFC6062 with active peer). Implies -T.
 *      *-S*     Secure connection: TLS for TCP, DTLS for UDP.
 *      *-U*     Secure unencrypted connection (suite eNULL): SSL/TLS for TCP, DTLS for UDP.
 *      *-v*     Verbose.
 *      *-s*     Use "Send" method	in TURN; by default, it	uses TURN Channels.
 *      *-y*     Use  client-to-client  connections: RTP/RTCP pair	of channels to another RTP/RTCP pair of channels.  with this  option  the  _turnutils_peer_ application  is  not used, as the allocated relay endpoints	are talking to each other.
 *      *-h*     Hang on indefinitely after the last sent packet.
 *      *-c*     Do not create rtcp connections.
 *      *-x*     Request IPv6 relayed address (RFC6156).
 *      *-g*     Set DONT_FRAGMENT	parameter in TURN requests.
 *      *-A*     Use short-term credentials mechanism for authentication. By default, the program uses the long-term credentials mechanism if authentication is required.
 *      *-D*     Mandatory channels padding (like in *pjnath*).
 *      *-N*     Negative tests (some limited cases only).
 *      *-O*     "DOS attack" intense mode.

===Options:===

 *      *-l* {{{<number>}}}     Message length (Default: 100 Bytes).
 *      *-i* {{{<file-name>}}}     Certificate file (for secure connections only).
 *      *-k* {{{<file-name>}}}     Private key file (for secure connections only).
 *      *-p* {{{<port>}}}     *TURN* *Server* port (Default: 3478 unsecure,	5349 secure).
 *      *-n* {{{<number>}}}     Number of	messages to send (Default: 5).
 *      *-d* {{{<device-name>}}}     Local interface device (optional, Linux only).
 *      *-L* {{{<ip>}}}     Local IP address (optional).
 *      *-m* {{{<number>}}}     Number of	clients	(default is 1, 2 or 4,	depending  on  options below).
 *      *-e* {{{<ip>}}}     Peer address.
 *      *-r* {{{<port>}}}     Peer port	(default 3480).
 *	*-z* {{{<number>}}}     Per-session packet interval in milliseconds (default is 20 ms).
 *	*-u* {{{<user>}}}     STUN/TURN username.
 *	*-w* {{{<password>}}}     STUN/TURN user password.
 *	*-W* {{{<secret>}}}     TURN REST API secret. Is not compatible with -A flag.
 *	*-C* {{{<symbol>}}}     This is the username/timestamp separator symbol (character) in TURN REST API. The default value is ':'.
