Currently implemented functionality:

1) RFC5389 (new STUN protocol) full server and client 
implementations. We do not maintain strict compatibility 
with the obsolete RFC 3489 "old STUN" protocol.

2) RFC5766 TURN protocol full server and client 
implementations. We support file-based long term 
user credentials, for now.

3) RFC6156 TURN IPv6 extension.

4) We support the following client-to-server 
network transports for TURN messages:
	a) UDP
	b) TCP
	c) TLS
	
5) Performance tested and fixed.

6) Stability tested and fixed.

7) Multiple *NIX platforms tested and supported.
 
Things to be implemented in future are described in TODO file.
