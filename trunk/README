I. GENERAL INFORMATION

This directory contains the source code of a TURN server and TURN client messaging 
library. Also, four extra programs provided, for testing-only purposes. 

Current version is 1.0.

After the build (see INSTALL file), you will have the following binary images:

1) turnserver: TURN server relay. 
The compiled binary image of this program is located in bin/ sub-directory.

2) turnadmin: TURN administration tool.
This tool can be used to generate TURN keys.

3) uclient: asynch multiple UDP clients. (for testing purposes only !)
The compiled binary image of this program is located in testapps/bin/ sub-directory.

WARNING: the uclient program is a primitive client application. 
It does not implement the re-transmission pattern that is necessary for 
a correct TURN client implementation. In TURN, the retransmission burden 
is lying entirely on the client application.

4) peer: (for testing purposes only !) a simple stateless UDP-only "echo" server, 
	to be used as the final server in relay pattern ("peer"). When clients are 
	communicating in the client-to-client manner, this component is not needed.
	
The compiled binary image of this program is located in testapps/bin/ subdirectory.
   
5) stunclient: a simple STUN client example.
The compiled binary image of this program is located in testapps/bin/ subdirectory.

See INSTALL for the compilation instructions.
  
II. RUN

1) turnserver application is a TURN relay server implementation. 

The command line parameters are:

	-d, --listening-device          Listener interface device (optional, 
                                        Linux only).
	-p, --listening-port            TURN listener port for UDP and TCP 
                                        listeners (Default: 3478).
	    --tls-listening-port        TURN listener port for TLS listeners 
					(Default: 5349).
	-L, --listening-ip		Listener IP address of relay server. 
					Multiple listeners can be specified.
					If no IP(s) specified, then all IPv4 and 
					IPv6 system IPs will be used for listening.
	-i, --relay-device		Relay interface device for relay sockets 
					(optional, Linux only).
	-E, --relay-ip			Relay address (the local IP address that 
                                        will be used to relay the packets to the 
                                        peer). Multiple relay addresses may be used.
					If no relay IP(s) specified, then all 
					non-loopback system IPs will be used.
	-m, --relay-threads		number of extra threads to handle the 
					established connections.
					By default, everything in handled in single thread 
					(the default number of extra threads is 0).
	-l, --min-port			Lower bound of the UDP port range for relay 
					endpoints allocation.
					Default value is 49152, according to RFC 5766.
	-r, --max-port			Upper bound of the UDP port range for relay 
					endpoints allocation.
					Default value is 65535, according to RFC 5766.
	-v, --verbose			Verbose.
	-f, --fingerprint		Use fingerprints in the TURN messages.
	-a, --lt-cred-mech		Use long-term credential mechanism.
	-u, --user			User account, in the column-separated 
                                        form 'username:key'. The key is generated 
                                        by bin/turnadmin command.
					The key is calculated over the user name, 
                                        the realm, and the user password.
	-e, --realm			Realm.
	-q, --user-quota		Per-user allocation quota.
	-Q, --total-quota		total allocation quota.
	-c				Configuration file name (default - turn.conf).
					The format of config file can be seen in 
                                        the supplied etc/turn.conf example file. 
                                        Long names of the options are used as 
					the configuration items names in the file.  
					If not absolute path is supplied, then the file is 
					searched first in the current directory, then 
					in ./etc, then in /etc, then in /usr/local/etc.
	-n				Do not use configuration file.
	    --cert			Certificate file, PEM format. Same file 
                                        search rules applied as for the configuration 
                                        file. If --no-tls option is specified, 
                                        then this parameter is not needed.
	    --pkey			Private key file, PEM format. Same file 
                                        search rules applied as for the configuration 
                                        file. If --no-tls option is specified, 
                                        then this parameter is not needed.
	    --no-udp			Do not start UDP listeners.
	    --no-tcp			Do not start TCP listeners.
	    --no-tls			Do not start TLS listeners.
	-h				help.
	
2) turnadmin application is a TURN relay administration tool. 

Usage:

Generate a key:
$ turnadmin -k -u <username> -r <realm> -p <password>

Add/update a user (and realm) in the config file:
$ turnadmin -a [-c <config-file>] -u <username> -r <realm> -p <password>

Delete a user from the config file:
$ turnadmin -d [-c <config-file>] -u <username>

Help:
$ turnadmin -h  

The command line parameters are:

	-k, --key		Command: generate key for a user.
	-a, --add       	Command: add or update a user.
	-d, --delete		Command: delete a user.
	-c, --config-file 	Configuration file.
	-u, --user		User name.
	-r, --realm		Realm.
	-p, --password		Password.
	-h, --help		Help.
    
3) uclient application is for test purposes only. 
It was designed to simulate multiple clients. It uses asynch IO API in 
libevent to handle multiple clients. A client connects to the relay, 
negotiates the session, and sends multiple (configured number) messages to the server (relay), 
expecting the same number of replies. The length of the messages is configurable. 
The message is an arbitrary octet stream, but it can be configured as a string. 
The number of the messages to send is configurable. 

The command-line parameters are:

	-l      Message length (Default: 100 Bytes);
	-t	Use TCP (default is UDP).
        -S	Secure connection: TLS for TCP, DTLS for UDP.
    		NOTE: DTLS is not supported now.
	-i	Certificate file (for secure connections only).
	-k	Private key file (for secure connections only).
	-p      TURN server port (Default: 3478 unsecure, 5349 secure);
	-n      Number of messages to send (Default: 5);
	-d      Local interface device (optional);
	-L      Local IP address (optional);
	-v      Verbose;
	-m      Number of clients (default is 1, 2 or 4, depending on options below);
	-s      Use "send" method in TURN; by default, it uses TURN "channels".
	-y      Use client-to-client connections: 
	    	RTP/RTCP pair of channels to another RTP/RTCP pair of channels;
	    	with this option the peer application is not used,
	    	as the relay endpoints are talking to each other; 
	-h      Hang on indefinitely after the last sent packet;
	-e      Peer address;
	-r      Peer port (default 3479);
	-c      Do not create rtcp connections;
	-x      Request IPv6 relayed address (RFC6156);
	-g      Set DONT_FRAGMENT parameter in TURN requests;
    
4) peer application is a simple UDP-only echo backend server. This application
is used for the test purposes only, as a 'peer' for the uclient application. 

The command line parameters are:

    -p      Listening UDP port (Default: 3479). 
    -d	    Listening interface device (optional)
    -L      Listening address of peer server
    -v      verbose

5) stunclient is a basic STUN client. It sends a STUN request and shows the reply information.

Usage: stunclient [options] <IP-address>

The command line parameters are:

    -p      STUN server port (Default: 3478). 
    -L      local address to use (optional).
