# Relay address (the local IP address that will be used to relay the packets to the peer).
# Multiple relay addresses may be used.

# "External" TURN Server address if the server is behind NAT.
# In the server-behind-NAT situation, only one relay address must be used, and
# that single relay address must be mapped by NAT to the 'external' IP.
# For this 'external' IP, NAT must forward ports directly (relayed port 12345
# must be always mapped to the same 'external' port 12345).
# This value, if not empty, is returned in XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS field.
# By default, this value is empty, and the real relay IP address is used.
#

# Uncomment to use long-term credential mechanism.
# By default no credentials mechanism is used (any user allowed).
#
#lt-cred-mech

# This option is opposite to lt-cred-meech 
# (TURN Server with no-auth option allows anonymous access).
# If neither option is defined, and no users are defined,
# then no-auth is default. If at least one user is defined, 
# in this file or in command line or in usersdb file, then
# lt-cred-mech is default.
#
#no-auth

# Flag that sets a special authorization option that is based upon authentication secret.
# This feature purpose is to support "TURN Server REST API" as described in
# TURNServerRESTAPI.pdf in the docs.
#
# This option is used with timestamp:
# 
# usercombo -> "user_id:timestamp"
# turn user -> usercombo
# turn password -> base64(hmac(secret key, usercombo))
#
# This allows TURN credentials to be accounted for a specific user id.
# If you don't have a suitable id, the timestamp alone can be used.
# This option is just turns on secret-based authentication.
# The actual value of the secret is defined either by option static-auth-secret,
# or can be found in the turn_secret table in the database (see below).
# 
#use-auth-secret

# 'Static' authentication secret value (a string). If not set, then the turn server
# will try to use the 'dynamic' value in turn_secret table
# in user database (if present). The database-stored  value can be changed on-the-fly
# by a separate program, so this is why that other mode is 'dynamic'.
#
#static-auth-secret

# Expiration time for timestamp used with authentication secret, in seconds.
# The default value is 86400 (24 hours).
# This is 'TTL' in terms of TURNServerRESTAPI.pdf document.

# 'Static' user accounts
# 'Static' user accounts are NOT dynamically checked by the turnserver process, 
# so that they can NOT be changed while the turnserver is running.
#
#user=username1:key1
#user=username2:key2
# OR:
#user=username1:password1
#user=username2:password2
#
# Keys must be generated by turnadmin utility. The key value depends
# on user name, realm, and password:
#
# Example:
# $ turnadmin -k -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
# Output: 0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# ('0x' in the beginning of the key is what differentiates the key from
# password. If it has 0x then it is a key, otherwise it is a password).
#
# The corresponding user account entry in the config file will be:
# 
#user=ninefingers:0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# Or, equivalently (less secure):
#user=ninefingers:youhavetoberealistic
#

# 'Dynamic' user accounts database file name
# 'Dynamic' user accounts are dynamically checked by the turnserver process, 
# so that they can be changed while the turnserver is running.

#no-stdout-log

# Option to set the log file name.
# By default, the turnserver tries to open a log file in 
# /var/log, /var/tmp, /tmp and current directories directories

# With this option you can set the definite log file name.
# The special names are "stdout" and "-" - they will force everything
