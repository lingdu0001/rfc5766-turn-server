.SH GENERAL INFORMATION

The \fBTURN Server\fP project contains the source code of a TURN server and TURN client 
messaging library. Also, some extra programs provided, for testing-only 
purposes. 
.PP
See the INSTALL file for the building instructions.
.PP
After the build, you will have the following binary images:
.TP
.B
1.
\fIturnserver\fP: \fBTURN Server\fP relay. 
The compiled binary image of this program is located in bin/ sub-directory.
.TP
.B
2.
\fIturnadmin\fP: TURN administration tool. This tool can be used to generate 
TURN keys for the user accounts. For security reasons, we do not recommend 
storing passwords openly. The better option is to use pre-processed "keys" 
which are then used for authentication. These keys are generated by \fIturnadmin\fP. 
Turnadmin is a link to \fIturnserver\fP binary, but \fIturnadmin\fP performs different 
functions.
.TP
.B
3.
\fIuclient\fP: emulates multiple UDP,TCP,TLS or DTLS clients. 
(this program is provided for the testing purposes only !)
The compiled binary image of this program is located in turn.examples/bin/ 
sub-directory.
.PP
WARNING: the \fIuclient\fP program is a primitive client application. 
It does not implement the re-transmission pattern that is necessary for 
a correct TURN client implementation. In TURN, the retransmission burden 
is lying entirely on the client application. We provide the messaging 
functionality in the client library, but the client must implement 
the correct Networking IO processing in the client program code.
.TP
.B
4.
\fIpeer\fP: a simple stateless UDP-only "echo" server, 
to be used as the final server in relay pattern ("\fIpeer\fP"). For every incoming 
UDP packet, it simply echoes it back.
(this program is provided for the testing purposes only !) 
When the test clients are communicating in the client-to-client manner, 
this component is not needed.
.PP
The compiled binary image of this program is located in turn.examples/bin/ subdirectory.
.TP
.B
5.
\fIstunclient\fP: a simple STUN client example.
The compiled binary image of this program is located in turn.examples/bin/ subdirectory.
.PP
In the "scripts" subdirectory, you will find the examples of command lines to be used 
to run the programs.

3.
\fIuclient\fP application is for test purposes only. 
It was designed to simulate multiple clients. It uses asynch IO API in 
libevent to handle multiple clients. A client connects to the relay, 
negotiates the session, and sends multiple (configured number) messages to the server (relay), 
expecting the same number of replies. The length of the messages is configurable. 
The message is an arbitrary octet stream, but it can be configured as a string. 
The number of the messages to send is configurable.

.SH LIBRARIES

In the lib/ sub-directory the build process will create TURN client messaging library.
In the include/ sub-directory, the necessary include files will be placed.
.SH DOCS

After installation, run the command:
.PP
$ man \fIturnserver\fP
.PP
to see the man page.
.SH LOGS

The \fBTURN Server\fP makes efforts to create a log file turn_<pid>.log 
in the following directories:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
/var/log
.IP \(bu 3
/log/
.IP \(bu 3
/var/tmp
.IP \(bu 3
/tmp
.IP \(bu 3
current directory
.RE
.PP
If all efforts failed (due to the system permission settings) then all 
log messages are sent only to the standard output of the process.
